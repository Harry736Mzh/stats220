# Stats220
## About This Repository

This is my repo for STATS 220. Here's a little about me:

- **Major**: I am undertaking a degree in *Mathematics*.
- **Reason**: I am taking STATS 220 because I'm very interested in data and numbers.

### My Interests
1. When I play games, I open the data in the game, such as network latency and fps.
2. I am very interested in how data changes.

My love for statistics![](https://media4.giphy.com/media/v1.Y2lkPTc5MGI3NjExN3p6Nmp3dDV0YTR4cjRya3pweTM0MDFldmxveXdwMGlwMWY5ZHRmNSZlcD12MV9pbnRlcm5hbF9naWZfYnlfaWQmY3Q9Zw/tpVKvAabWt3G5csMkT/giphy.gif)
