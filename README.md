# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Mathematics.
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm very interested in data and numbers, and when I play games, I open the data in the game, such as network latency and fps, and I am very interested in data changes.
- I am interested in learning about everything about data.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
