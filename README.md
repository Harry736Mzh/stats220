# Stats220
## About This Repository

This is my repo for STATS 220. Here's a little about me:

- **Bold**: I am undertaking a degree in *Mathematics*.
- **Italic**: I am taking STATS 220 because I'm very interested in data and numbers.

### My Interests
1. When I play games, I open the data in the game, such as network latency and fps.
2. I am very interested in how data changes.
